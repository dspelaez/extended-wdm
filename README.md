# :sparkles: :ocean: Extended Wavelet Directional Method (EWDM) :ocean: :sparkles:

:wave: "Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Extended Wavelet Directional Method (EWDM) - a toolkit for estimating directional ocean wave spectra based on Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT). This algorithm is an extension of the original WDM proposed by [Donelan et al. (1985)](10.1175/1520-0485(1996)026<1901:naotdp>2.0.co;2) that was only suitable for spatially-distributed arrays of wave staffs. This extension allows the estimation of the directional wave spectrum for GPS wave buoys, pitch-roll-heave buoys and Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers.

:zap: The wavelet-based methods have emerged as a practical alternative to the conventional Fourier-based techniques, particularly well-suited for the analysis of data
from [Spotter buoys](https://www.sofarocean.com/products/spotter) as demonstrated by [Pel√°ez-Zapata et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1175/JTECH-D-23-0058.1) and from other triplet data such as wave slopes as shown by [Krogstad et al. 2006](https://onepetro.org/IJOPE/article-abstract/28936/Wavelet-And-Local-Directional-Analysis-of-Ocean?redirectedFrom=fulltext).

Key features of the EWDM include:

* Implementation of the wavelet-based algorithms for extracting directional information from wave time series
* Tools for processing and visualising directional wave data
* Helper functions to handle commonly used data sources such as [Spotter buoys](https://www.sofarocean.com/products/spotter) and [CDIP](https://cdip.ucsd.edu/)
* Extensive documentation, examples, and comparison with conventional methods.

:ocean: Whether you are a researcher, student, or engineer in physical oceanography, the Extended Wavelet Directional Method provides a powerful, user-friendly toolkit for
in-depth analysis of directional ocean wave spectra. Join us in exploring the fascinating world of directional wave analysis and making meaningful contributions to
the understanding of ocean wave dynamics. We welcome contributions, feedback, and collaboration from the community to further enhance the capabilities of the Extended Wavelet Directional Method.

Happy coding and wave analysis! :wave:
